# python-minesweeper
    As part of my endeavour to learn Python this a coding challenge I've set myself.
    I'm attempting to create a Minesweeper game using Python and Tkinter.
    This is my first exposure to GitHub so this is also a good learning challenge.
    
    If you want to view my code and offer constructive advice please do, any advice
    will be greatly recieved.. :-)
